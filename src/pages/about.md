Hello my name is Teodoro Garcia, I am a developer currently working with Infosys Ltd in the Greater Austin Area. My background is actually in History and I made the switch to tech during the Covid Pandemic. I have always been a techie and have really found my calling here! I still love History but now it is more of a hobby than a profession. 

My hobbies are playing rugby for the Austin Huns, hiking, fly-fishing, travel, camping, and occasional video games. I'm an avid reader and dungeons and dragons player!
